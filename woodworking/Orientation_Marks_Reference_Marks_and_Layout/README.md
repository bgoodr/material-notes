Below is a cheetsheet using some of the images from the above webpages:

The following syntax should work, but does not:

![alt text](Orientation_Marks_Reference_Marks_and_Layout.svg)(Orientation Marks Reference Marks and Layout CheatSheet)

Apparently the bug https://github.com/github/markup/issues/556 was stated as being fixed/closed, but it is still not working.

But even if I have a link like this:

[Orientation Marks Reference Marks and Layout CheatSheet](Orientation_Marks_Reference_Marks_and_Layout.svg)

And the user clicks on it, the resulting web page renders the arrow
heads in a DIFFERENT color than what Inkscape says it should! Pah! I
give up in disgust: I have no choice but to hack around that defect
use a Makefile to run Inkscape on the SVG file and render it. Then I
can have the image inlined as $DIETY's intended.
